As the name itself suggests, it is a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics – Data Structure and Algorithms.Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)Topics   A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially.The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:Here comes one of the interesting and important topics. The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently. How can you decide if a program written by you is efficient or not? This is measured by complexities. Complexity is of two types:Both of the above complexities are measured with respect to the input parameters. But here arises a problem. The time required for executing a code depends on several factors, such as: So how can we determine which one is efficient? The answer is the use of asymptotic notation. Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool that calculates the required time in terms of input size and does not require the execution of the code. It neglects the system-dependent constants and is related to only the number of modular operations being performed in the whole program. The following 3 asymptotic notations are mostly used to represent the time complexity of algorithms:Rate of Growth of AlgorithmsThe most used notation in the analysis of a code is the Big O Notation which gives an upper bound of the running time of the code (or the amount of memory used in terms of input size).To learn about complexity analysis in detail, you can refer to our complete set of articles on the Analysis of Algorithms.Here comes the most crucial and the most awaited stage of the roadmap for learning data structure and algorithm – the stage where you start learning about DSA. The topic of DSA consists of two parts: Though they are two different things, they are highly interrelated, and it is very important to follow the right track to learn them most efficiently. If you are confused about which one to learn first, we recommend you to go through our detailed analysis on the topic: What should I learn first- Data Structures or Algorithms?Here we have followed the flow of learning a data structure and then the most related and important algorithms used by that data structure.The most basic yet important data structure is the array. It is a linear data structure. An array is a collection of homogeneous data types where the elements are allocated contiguous memory. Because of the contiguous allocation of memory, any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. Each array element has a corresponding index number. Array Data StructureTo learn more about arrays, refer to the article “Introduction to Arrays“.Here are some topics about array which you must learn:Related posts:A string is also a type of array. It can be interpreted as an array of characters. But it has some special characteristics like the last character of a string is a null character to denote the end of the string. Also, there are some unique operations, like concatenation which concatenates two strings into one.String Data StructureHere we are providing you with some must-know concepts of string:Related posts:As the above data structures, the linked list is also a linear data structure. But Linked List is different from Array in its configuration. It is not allocated to contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node of the linked list is allocated to some random memory space and the previous node maintains a pointer that points to this node. So no direct memory access of any node is possible and it is also dynamic i.e., the size of the linked list can be adjusted at any time. To learn more about linked lists refer to the article “Introduction to Linked List“.Linked List Data StructureThe topics which you must want to cover are:Related posts:A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.For example:A matrix with 9 elements is shown below.This Matrix [M] has 3 rows and 3 columns. Each element of matrix [M] can be referred to by its row and column number. For example, a23 = 6.Related posts:Now you should move to some more complex data structures, such as Stack and Queue. Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).Stack Data StructureThe reason why Stack is considered a complex data structure is that it uses other data structures for implementation, such as Arrays, Linked lists, etc. based on the characteristics and features of Stack data structure.Related posts:Another data structure that is similar to Stack, yet different in its characteristics, is Queue.A Queue is a linear structure which follows First In First Out (FIFO) approach in its individual operations.Queue Data StructureA queue can be of different types like Related posts:A Heap is a special Tree-based Data Structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.Types of heaps:Generally, heaps are of two types.Max-Heap: In this heap, the value of the root node must be the greatest among all its child nodes and the same thing must be done for its left and right sub-tree also.Min-Heap: In this heap, the value of the root node must be the smallest among all its child nodes and the same thing must be done for its left ans right sub-tree also.Types of Heap Data StructureRelated posts:Hashing refers to the process of generating a fixed-size output from an input of variable size using the mathematical formulas known as hash functions. This technique determines an index or location for the storage of an item in a data structure.What is HashingRelated posts:After having the basics covered about the linear data structure, now it is time to take a step forward to learn about the non-linear data structures. The first non-linear data structure you should learn is the tree. Tree data structure is similar to a tree we see in nature but it is upside down. It also has a root and leaves. The root is the first node of the tree and the leaves are the ones at the bottom-most level. The special characteristic of a tree is that there is only one path to go from any of its nodes to any other node.Tree Data StructureBased on the maximum number of children of a node of the tree it can be – Based on the configuration of nodes there are also several classifications. Some of them are:Related posts:Another important non-linear data structure is the graph. It is similar to the Tree data structure, with the difference that there is no particular root or leaf node, and it can be traversed in any order.A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes. Graph Data StructureEach edge shows a connection between a pair of nodes. This data structure helps solve many real-life problems. Based on the orientation of the edges and the nodes there are various types of graphs. Here are some must to know concepts of graphs:Related posts:Once you have cleared the concepts of Data Structures, now its time to start your journey through the Algorithms. Based on the type of nature and usage, the Algorithms are grouped together into several categories, as shown below:Now we have learned about some linear data structures and is time to learn about some basic and most used algorithms which are hugely used in these types of data structures. One such algorithm is the searching algorithm. Searching algorithms are used to find a specific element in an array, string, linked list, or some other data structure. The most common searching algorithms are:Besides these, there are other searching algorithms also like Here is one other most used algorithm. Often we need to arrange or sort data as per a specific condition. The sorting algorithm is the one that is used in these cases. Based on conditions we can sort a set of homogeneous data in order like sorting an array in increasing or decreasing order. Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.An example to show SortingThere are a lot of different types of sorting algorithms. Some widely used algorithms are:There are several other sorting algorithms also and they are beneficial in different cases. You can learn about them and more in our dedicated article on Sorting algorithms.This is one interesting and important algorithm to be learned in your path of programming. As the name suggests, it breaks the problem into parts, then solves each part and after that again merges the solved subtasks to get the actual problem solved. Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps.This is the primary technique mentioned in the two sorting algorithms Merge Sort and Quick Sort which are mentioned earlier. To learn more about the technique, the cases where it is used, and its implementation and solve some interesting problems, please refer to the dedicated article Divide and Conquer Algorithm.As the name suggests, this algorithm builds up the solution one piece at a time and chooses the next piece which gives the most obvious and immediate benefit i.e., which is the most optimal choice at that moment. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to the global solutions are best fit for Greedy.For example, consider the Fractional Knapsack Problem. The local optimal strategy is to choose the item that has maximum value vs weight ratio. This strategy also leads to a globally optimal solution because we are allowed to take fractions of an item.Fractional Knapsack ProblemHere is how you can get started with the Greedy algorithm with the help of relevant sub-topics:Recursion is one of the most important algorithms which uses the concept of code reusability and repeated usage of the same piece of code. RecursionThe point which makes Recursion one of the most used algorithms is that it forms the base for many other algorithms such as:In Recursion, you can follow the below articles/links to get the most out of it: As mentioned earlier, the Backtracking algorithm is derived from the Recursion algorithm, with the option to revert if a recursive solution fails, i.e. in case a solution fails, the program traces back to the moment where it failed and builds on another solution. So basically it tries out all the possible solutions and finds the correct one.Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time Some important and most common problems of backtracking algorithms, that you must solve before moving ahead, are:Another crucial algorithm is dynamic programming. Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for the same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The main concept of the Dynamic Programming algorithm is to use the previously calculated result to avoid repeated calculations of the same subtask which helps in reducing the time complexity. Dynamic ProgrammingTo learn more about dynamic programming and practice some interesting problems related to it, refer to the following articles:The Pattern Searching algorithms are sometimes also referred to as String Searching Algorithms and are considered as a part of the String algorithms. These algorithms are useful in the case of searching a string within another string.These algorithms are designed to solve Mathematical and Number Theory problems. They requires in-depth knowledge of different mathematical subjects likeThese algorithms are designed to solve Geometric Problems. They requires in-depth knowledge of different mathematical subjects like:LinesTriangleRectangleSquareCircle3D ObjectsQuadilateralPolygon & Convex HullFor Example: Comparing Slopes of two lines, Finding Equation of a plane etc.11. Bitwise AlgorithmsThe Bitwise Algorithms is used to perform operations at the bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways. The bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are sometimes used to improve the efficiency of a program.For example: To check if a number is even or odd. This can be easily done by using Bitwise-AND(&) operator. If the last bit of the operator is set than it is ODD otherwise it is EVEN. Therefore, if num & 1 not equals to zero than num is ODD otherwise it is EVEN.12. Randomized AlgorithmsAn algorithm that uses random numbers to decide what to do next anywhere in its logic is called Randomized Algorithm. For example, in Randomized Quick Sort, we use a random number to pick the next pivot (or we randomly shuffle the array). Typically, this randomness is used to reduce time complexity or space complexity in other standard algorithms.13. Branch and Bound AlgorithmBranch and bound is an algorithm design paradigm which is generally used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. These problems are typically exponential in terms of time complexity and may require exploring all possible permutations in worst case. The Branch and Bound Algorithm technique solves these problems relatively quickly.4.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-1-asymptotic-analysis/?ref=ghm,Asymptotic Notation and Analysis (Based on input size) in Complexity Analysis of Algorithms,"Asymptotic Analysis is defined as the big idea that handles the above issues in analyzing algorithms. In Asymptotic Analysis, we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we don’t measure the actual running time). We calculate, how the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size. There are many important things that should be taken care of, like user-friendliness, modularity, security, maintainability, etc. Why worry about performance?  The answer to this is simple, we can have all the above things only if we have performance. So performance is like currency through which we can buy all the above things. Another reason for studying performance is – speed is fun! To summarize, performance == scale. Imagine a text editor that can load 1000 pages, but can spell check 1 page per minute OR an image editor that takes 1 hour to rotate your image 90 degrees left OR … you get it. If a software feature can not cope with the scale of tasks users need to perform – it is as good as dead. One naive way of doing this is – to implement both the algorithms and run the two programs on your computer for different inputs and see which one takes less time. There are many problems with this approach for the analysis of algorithms. Asymptotic Analysis is the big idea that handles the above issues in analyzing algorithms. In Asymptotic Analysis, we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we don’t measure the actual running time). We calculate, how the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size. For example, let us consider the search problem (searching a given item) in a sorted array. The solution to above search problem includes: To understand how Asymptotic Analysis solves the problems mentioned above in analyzing algorithms, Running times for this example: Asymptotic Analysis is not perfect, but that’s the best way available for analyzing algorithms. For example, say there are two sorting algorithms that take 1000nLogn and 2nLogn time respectively on a machine. Both of these algorithms are asymptotically the same (order of growth is nLogn). So, With Asymptotic Analysis, we can’t judge which one is better as we ignore constants in Asymptotic Analysis. Also, in Asymptotic analysis, we always talk about input sizes larger than a constant value. It might be possible that those large inputs are never given to your software and an asymptotically slower algorithm always performs better for your particular situation. So, you may end up choosing an algorithm that is Asymptotically slower but faster for your software.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or if you want to share more information about the topic discussed aboveSolve DSA problems on GfG Practice.In JAVA/C++ Language",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-2-asymptotic-analysis/?ref=ghm,"Worst, Average and Best Case Analysis of Algorithms","In the previous post, we discussed how Asymptotic analysis overcomes the problems of the naive way of analyzing algorithms. But let’s take an overview of the asymptotic notation and learn about What is Worst, Average, and Best cases of an algorithm:We define an algorithm’s worst-case time complexity by using the Big-O notation, which determines the set of functions grows slower than or at the same rate as the expression. Furthermore, it explains the maximum amount of time an algorithm requires to consider all input values.It defines the best case of an algorithm’s time complexity, the Omega notation defines whether the set of functions will grow faster or at the same rate as the expression. Furthermore, it explains the minimum amount of time an algorithm requires to consider all input values.It defines the average case of an algorithm’s time complexity, the Theta notation defines when the set of functions lies in both O(expression) and Omega(expression), then Theta notation is used. This is how we define a time complexity average case for an algorithm. Based on the above three notations of Time Complexity there are three cases to analyze an algorithm:In the worst-case analysis, we calculate the upper bound on the running time of an algorithm. We must know the case that causes a maximum number of operations to be executed. For Linear Search, the worst case happens when the element to be searched (x) is not present in the array. When x is not present, the search() function compares it with all the elements of arr[] one by one. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of the linear search would be O(n).In the best-case analysis, we calculate the lower bound on the running time of an algorithm. We must know the case that causes a minimum number of operations to be executed. In the linear search problem, the best case occurs when x is present at the first location. The number of operations in the best case is constant (not dependent on n). So time complexity in the best case would be Ω(1) In average case analysis, we take all possible inputs and calculate the computing time for all of the inputs. Sum all the calculated values and divide the sum by the total number of inputs. We must know (or predict) the distribution of cases. For the linear search problem, let us assume that all cases are uniformly distributed (including the case of x not being present in the array). So we sum all the cases and divide the sum by (n+1). Following is the value of average-case time complexity.  Average Case Time = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\theta (i)}{(n+1)} = \frac{\theta (\frac{(n+1)*(n+2)}{2})}{(n+1)} = \theta (n)Below is the ranked mention of complexity analysis notation based on popularity:Most of the time, we do worst-case analyses to analyze algorithms. In the worst analysis, we guarantee an upper bound on the running time of an algorithm which is good information. The average case analysis is not easy to do in most practical cases and it is rarely done. In the average case analysis, we must know (or predict) the mathematical distribution of all possible inputs. The Best Case analysis is bogus. Guaranteeing a lower bound on an algorithm doesn’t provide any information as in the worst case, an algorithm may take years to run.A) For some algorithms, all the cases (worst, best, average) are asymptotically the same. i.e., there are no worst and best cases. B) Where as most of the other sorting algorithms have worst and best cases. Time Complexity Analysis: (In Big-O notation)2. In this example, we will take an array of length (n) and deals with the following cases :Below is the implementation of the given problem:Time Complexity Analysis:For more details, please refer: Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-3asymptotic-notations/?ref=ghm,Types of Asymptotic Notations in Complexity Analysis of Algorithms,"We have discussed Asymptotic Analysis, and Worst, Average, and Best Cases of Algorithms. The main idea of asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of the efficiency of algorithms that don’t depend on machine-specific constants and don’t require algorithms to be implemented and time taken by programs to be compared. Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis.There are mainly three asymptotic notations:Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm.  Let g and f be the function from the set of natural numbers to itself. The function f is said to be Θ(g), if there are constants c1, c2 > 0 and a natural number n0 such that c1* g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n) for all n ≥ n0Theta notationΘ (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0 such that 0 ≤ c1 * g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n) for all n ≥ n0}Note: Θ(g) is a setThe above expression can be described as if f(n) is theta of g(n), then the value f(n) is always between c1 * g(n) and c2 * g(n) for large values of n (n ≥ n0). The definition of theta also requires that f(n) must be non-negative for values of n greater than n0.The execution time serves as both a lower and upper bound on the algorithm’s time complexity. It exist as both, most, and least boundaries for a given input value.A simple way to get the Theta notation of an expression is to drop low-order terms and ignore leading constants. For example, Consider the expression 3n3 + 6n2 + 6000 = Θ(n3), the dropping lower order terms is always fine because there will always be a number(n) after which Θ(n3) has higher values than Θ(n2) irrespective of the constants involved. For a given function g(n), we denote Θ(g(n)) is following set of functions. Examples :{ 100 , log (2000) , 10^4 } belongs to Θ(1){ (n/4) , (2n+3) , (n/100 + log(n)) } belongs to Θ(n){ (n^2+n) , (2n^2) , (n^2+log(n))} belongs to Θ( n2)Note: Θ provides exact bounds.Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Therefore, it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.If f(n) describes the running time of an algorithm, f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist a positive constant C and n0 such that, 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0It returns the highest possible output value (big-O)for a given input.The execution time serves as an upper bound on the algorithm’s time complexity.O(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0 }For example, Consider the case of Insertion Sort. It takes linear time in the best case and quadratic time in the worst case. We can safely say that the time complexity of the Insertion sort is O(n2). Note: O(n2) also covers linear time. If we use Θ notation to represent the time complexity of Insertion sort, we have to use two statements for best and worst cases: The Big-O notation is useful when we only have an upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm. Many times we easily find an upper bound by simply looking at the algorithm.   Examples :{ 100 , log (2000) , 10^4 } belongs to O(1)U { (n/4) , (2n+3) , (n/100 + log(n)) } belongs to O(n)U { (n^2+n) , (2n^2) , (n^2+log(n))} belongs to O( n^2) Note: Here, U represents union, we can write it in these manner because O provides exact or upper bounds .Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm.The execution time serves as a both lower bound on the algorithm’s time complexity.It is defined as the condition that allows an algorithm to complete statement execution in the shortest amount of time.Let g and f be the function from the set of natural numbers to itself. The function f is said to be Ω(g), if there is a constant c > 0 and a natural number n0 such that c*g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0Ω(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0 }Let us consider the same Insertion sort example here. The time complexity of Insertion Sort can be written as Ω(n), but it is not very useful information about insertion sort, as we are generally interested in worst-case and sometimes in the average case. Examples :{ (n^2+n) , (2n^2) , (n^2+log(n))} belongs to Ω( n^2)U { (n/4) , (2n+3) , (n/100 + log(n)) } belongs to Ω(n)U { 100 , log (2000) , 10^4 } belongs to Ω(1)Note: Here, U represents union, we can write it in these manner because Ω provides exact or lower bounds.If f(n) is O(g(n)) then a*f(n) is also O(g(n)), where a is a constant.Example:f(n) = 2n²+5 is O(n²) then, 7*f(n) = 7(2n²+5) = 14n²+35 is also O(n²).Similarly, this property satisfies both Θ and Ω notation.We can say,If f(n) is Θ(g(n)) then a*f(n) is also Θ(g(n)), where a is a constant. If f(n) is Ω (g(n)) then a*f(n) is also Ω (g(n)), where a is a constant.If f(n) is O(g(n)) and g(n) is O(h(n)) then f(n) = O(h(n)).Example:If f(n) = n, g(n) = n² and h(n)=n³n is O(n²) and n² is O(n³) then, n is O(n³)Similarly, this property satisfies both Θ and Ω notation.We can say,If f(n) is Θ(g(n)) and g(n) is Θ(h(n)) then f(n) = Θ(h(n)) .If f(n) is Ω (g(n)) and g(n) is Ω (h(n)) then f(n) = Ω (h(n))Reflexive properties are always easy to understand after transitive.If f(n) is given then f(n) is O(f(n)). Since MAXIMUM VALUE OF f(n) will be f(n) ITSELF!Hence x = f(n) and y = O(f(n) tie themselves in reflexive relation always.Example:f(n) = n² ; O(n²) i.e O(f(n))Similarly, this property satisfies both Θ and Ω notation.   We can say that,If f(n) is given then f(n) is Θ(f(n)).If f(n) is given then f(n) is Ω (f(n)).If f(n) is Θ(g(n)) then g(n) is Θ(f(n)).Example:If(n) = n² and g(n) = n²then, f(n) = Θ(n²) and g(n) = Θ(n²)This property only satisfies for Θ notation.If f(n) is O(g(n)) then g(n) is Ω (f(n)).Example:If(n) = n , g(n) = n²then n is O(n²) and n² is Ω (n) This property only satisfies O and Ω notations.1. If f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)) then f(n) = Θ(g(n))2. If f(n) = O(g(n)) and d(n)=O(e(n)) then f(n) + d(n) = O( max( g(n), e(n) )) Example:f(n) = n i.e O(n) d(n) = n² i.e O(n²) then f(n) + d(n) = n + n² i.e O(n²)3. If f(n)=O(g(n)) and d(n)=O(e(n)) then f(n) * d(n) = O( g(n) * e(n))Example: f(n) = n i.e O(n) d(n) = n² i.e O(n²)then f(n) * d(n) = n * n² = n³ i.e O(n³)_______________________________________________________________________________Note: If  f(n) = O(g(n)) then g(n) = Ω(f(n))  Important Links :For more details, please refer: Design and Analysis of Algorithms.Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice.In JAVA/C++ Language",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithems-little-o-and-little-omega-notations/?ref=ghm,Analysis of algorithms | little o and little omega notations,"The main idea of asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of the efficiency of algorithms that don’t depend on machine-specific constants, mainly because this analysis doesn’t require algorithms to be implemented and time taken by programs to be compared. We have already discussed Three main asymptotic notations. The following 2 more asymptotic notations are used to represent the time complexity of algorithms.Little ο asymptotic notationBig-Ο is used as a tight upper bound on the growth of an algorithm’s effort (this effort is described by the function f(n)), even though, as written, it can also be a loose upper bound. “Little-ο” (ο()) notation is used to describe an upper bound that cannot be tight. Definition: Let f(n) and g(n) be functions that map positive integers to positive real numbers. We say that f(n) is ο(g(n)) (or f(n) Ε ο(g(n))) if for any real constant c > 0, there exists an integer constant n0 ≥ 1 such that 0 ≤ f(n) < c*g(n).  Thus, little o() means loose upper-bound of f(n). Little o is a rough estimate of the maximum order of growth whereas Big-Ο may be the actual order of growth. In mathematical relation, f(n) = o(g(n)) means lim  f(n)/g(n) = 0 n→∞ Examples:Is 7n + 8 ∈ o(n2)? In order for that to be true, for any c, we have to be able to find an n0 that makes f(n) < c * g(n) asymptotically true. lets took some example, If c = 100,we check the inequality is clearly true. If c = 1/100 , we’ll have to use a little more imagination, but we’ll be able to find an n0. (Try n0 = 1000.) From these examples, the conjecture appears to be correct. then check limits, lim  f(n)/g(n) = lim  (7n + 8)/(n2) = lim  7/2n = 0 (l’hospital) n→∞ n→∞ n→∞ hence 7n + 8 ∈ o(n2)Little ω asymptotic notationDefinition : Let f(n) and g(n) be functions that map positive integers to positive real numbers. We say that f(n) is ω(g(n)) (or f(n) ∈ ω(g(n))) if for any real constant c > 0, there exists an integer constant n0 ≥ 1 such that f(n) > c * g(n) ≥ 0 for every integer n ≥ n0. f(n) has a higher growth rate than g(n) so main difference between Big Omega (Ω) and little omega (ω) lies in their definitions.In the case of Big Omega f(n)=Ω(g(n)) and the bound is 0<=cg(n)<=f(n), but in case of little omega, it is true for 0<=c*g(n)<f(n). The relationship between Big Omega (Ω) and Little Omega (ω) is similar to that of Big-Ο and Little o except that now we are looking at the lower bounds. Little Omega (ω) is a rough estimate of the order of the growth whereas Big Omega (Ω) may represent exact order of growth. We use ω notation to denote a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight. And, f(n) ∈ ω(g(n)) if and only if g(n) ∈ ο((f(n)). In mathematical relation, if f(n) ∈ ω(g(n)) then, lim  f(n)/g(n) = ∞ n→∞ Example: Prove that 4n + 6 ∈ ω(1); the little omega(ο) running time can be proven by applying limit formula given below. if lim  f(n)/g(n) = ∞ then functions f(n) is ω(g(n)) n→∞ here,we have functions f(n)=4n+6 and g(n)=1 lim   (4n+6)/(1) = ∞ n→∞ and,also for any c we can get n0 for this inequality 0 <= c*g(n) < f(n), 0 <= c*1 < 4n+6 Hence proved. This article is contributed by Kadam Patel.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lower-and-upper-bound-theory/?ref=ghm,Lower and Upper Bound Theory,"The Lower and Upper Bound Theory provides a way to find the lowest complexity algorithm to solve a problem. Before understanding the theory, first, let’s have a brief look at what Lower and Upper bounds are. 1. Lower Bound Theory: According to the lower bound theory, for a lower bound L(n) of an algorithm, it is not possible to have any other algorithm (for a common problem) whose time complexity is less than L(n) for random input. Also, every algorithm must take at least L(n) time in the worst case. Note that L(n) here is the minimum of all the possible algorithms, of maximum complexity. The Lower Bound is very important for any algorithm. Once we calculated it, then we can compare it with the actual complexity of the algorithm and if their order is the same then we can declare our algorithm as optimal. So in this section, we will be discussing techniques for finding the lower bound of an algorithm. Note that our main motive is to get an optimal algorithm, which is the one having its Upper Bound the Same as its Lower Bound (U(n)=L(n)). Merge Sort is a common example of an optimal algorithm.Trivial Lower Bound – It is the easiest method to find the lower bound. The Lower bounds which can be easily observed based on the number of input taken and the number of output produced are called Trivial Lower Bound. Example: Multiplication of n x n matrix, where, In the above example, it’s easily predictable that the lower bound is O(n2). Computational Model – The method is for all those algorithms that are comparison-based. For example, in sorting, we have to compare the elements of the list among themselves and then sort them accordingly. Similar is the case with searching and thus we can implement the same in this case. Now we will look at some examples to understand its usage.Ordered Searching – It is a type of searching in which the list is already sorted.Example-1: Linear search Explanation – In linear search, we compare the key with the first element if it does not match we compare it with the second element, and so on till we check against the nth element. Else we will end up with a failure. Example-2: Binary search Explanation – In binary search, we check the middle element against the key, if it is greater we search the first half else we check the second half and repeat the same process. The diagram below there is an illustration of binary search in an array consisting of 4 elements  Calculating the lower bound: The max no of comparisons is n. Let there be k levels in the tree. Thus the lower bound of any comparison-based search from a list of n elements cannot be less than log(n). Therefore we can say that Binary Search is optimal as its complexity is Θ(log n).Sorting – The diagram below is an example of a tree formed in sorting combinations with 3 elements.Example – For n elements, finding lower bound using computation model. Explanation – For n elements, we have a total of n! combinations (leaf nodes). (Refer to the diagram the total combinations are 3! or 6) also, it is clear that the tree formed is a binary tree. Each level in the diagram indicates a comparison. Let there be k levels => 2k is the total number of leaf nodes in a full binary tree thus in this case we have n!≤2k.As the k in the above example is the no of comparisons thus by computational model lower bound = k.  Using Lower bond theory to solve the algebraic problem:The complexity for solving here is 4 (excluding the returning). The above example shows us a simple way to solve an equation for a 2-degree polynomial i.e., 4 thus for nth degree polynomial we will have a complexity of O(n2). Let us demonstrate via an algorithm. Example: x+a0 is a polynomial of degree n.Loop within a loop => complexity = O(n2);Now to find an optimal algorithm we need to find the lower bound here (as per lower bound theory). As per Lower Bound Theory, The optimal algorithm to solve the above problem is the one having complexity O(n). Let’s prove this theorem using lower bounds.Theorem: To prove that the optimal algo of solving a n degree polynomial is O(n) Proof: The best solution for reducing the algo is to make this problem less complex by dividing the polynomial into several straight-line problems.The complexity of this code is O(n). This way of solving such equations is called Horner’s method. Here is where lower bound theory works and gives the optimum algorithm’s complexity as O(n). 2. Upper Bound Theory: According to the upper bound theory, for an upper bound U(n) of an algorithm, we can always solve the problem at most U(n) time. Time taken by a known algorithm to solve a problem with worse case input gives us the upper bound. Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice.In JAVA/C++ Language",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-4-analysis-of-loops/?ref=ghm,How to Analyse Loops for Complexity Analysis of Algorithms,"We have discussed Asymptotic Analysis,  Worst, Average and Best Cases and Asymptotic Notations in previous posts. In this post, an analysis of iterative programs with simple examples is discussed. The time complexity of a function (or set of statements) is considered as O(1) if it doesn’t contain a loop, recursion, and call to any other non-constant time function.  i.e. set of non-recursive and non-loop statementsExample: The Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(n) if the loop variables are incremented/decremented by a constant amount. For example following functions have O(n) time complexity. The time complexity is defined as an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the squared size of the input data, as in nested loops it is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. For example, the following sample loops have O(n2) time complexity Example:  Selection sort and Insertion Sort have O(n2) time complexity. The time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables are divided/multiplied by a constant amount. And also for recursive calls in the recursive function, the Time Complexity is considered as O(Logn).Example: Binary Search(refer iterative implementation) has O(Logn) time complexity.The Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(LogLogn) if the loop variables are reduced/increased exponentially by a constant amount. See this for mathematical details. When there are consecutive loops, we calculate time complexity as a sum of the time complexities of individual loops. As discussed here, the worst-case time complexity is the most useful among best, average and worst. Therefore we need to consider the worst case. We evaluate the situation when values in if-else conditions cause a maximum number of statements to be executed. For example, consider the linear search function where we consider the case when an element is present at the end or not present at all. When the code is too complex to consider all if-else cases, we can get an upper bound by ignoring if-else and other complex control statements. The time complexity of a recursive function can be written as a mathematical recurrence relation. To calculate time complexity, we must know how to solve recurrences. We will soon be discussing recurrence-solving techniques as a separate post. Quiz on Analysis of Algorithms For more details, please refer: Design and Analysis of Algorithms.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice.In JAVA/C++ Language",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithm-set-4-master-method-solving-recurrences/?ref=ghm,How to analyse Complexity of Recurrence Relation,"In the previous post, we discussed the analysis of loops. Many algorithms are recursive. When we analyze them, we get a recurrence relation for time complexity. We get running time on an input of size n as a function of n and the running time on inputs of smaller sizes. For example in Merge Sort, to sort a given array, we divide it into two halves and recursively repeat the process for the two halves. Finally, we merge the results. Time complexity of Merge Sort can be written as T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn. There are many other algorithms like Binary Search, Tower of Hanoi, etc. There are mainly three ways of solving recurrences:We make a guess for the solution and then we use mathematical induction to prove the guess is correct or incorrect. For example consider the recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + nWe guess the solution as T(n) = O(nLogn). Now we use induction to prove our guess.We need to prove that T(n) <= cnLogn. We can assume that it is true for values smaller than n.T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n     <= 2cn/2Log(n/2) + n       =  cnLogn – cnLog2 + n       =  cnLogn – cn + n    <= cnLognIn this method, we draw a recurrence tree and calculate the time taken by every level of the tree. Finally, we sum the work done at all levels. To draw the recurrence tree, we start from the given recurrence and keep drawing till we find a pattern among levels. The pattern is typically arithmetic or geometric series.  For example, consider the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/4) + T(n/2) + cn2            cn2            /      \  T(n/4)     T(n/2)If we further break down the expression T(n/4) and T(n/2), we get the following recursion tree.                    cn2              /             \          c(n2)/16          c(n2)/4   /         \            /         \T(n/16)  T(n/8)  T(n/8)    T(n/4) Breaking down further gives us following                       cn2                 /                \            c(n2)/16              c(n2)/4    /          \                 /          \c(n2)/256  c(n2)/64  c(n2)/64   c(n2)/16 /    \            /    \      /    \        /    \  To know the value of T(n), we need to calculate the sum of tree nodes level by level. If we sum the above tree level by level, we get the following series T(n)  = c(n^2 + 5(n^2)/16 + 25(n^2)/256) + ….The above series is a geometrical progression with a ratio of 5/16.To get an upper bound, we can sum the infinite series. We get the sum as (n2)/(1 – 5/16) which is O(n2)Master Method is a direct way to get the solution. The master method works only for the following type of recurrences or for recurrences that can be transformed into the following type.  T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) where a >= 1 and b > 1There are the following three cases: The master method is mainly derived from the recurrence tree method. If we draw the recurrence tree of T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), we can see that the work done at the root is f(n), and work done at all leaves is Θ(nc) where c is Logba. And the height of the recurrence tree is Logbn  In the recurrence tree method, we calculate the total work done. If the work done at leaves is polynomially more, then leaves are the dominant part, and our result becomes the work done at leaves (Case 1). If work done at leaves and root is asymptotically the same, then our result becomes height multiplied by work done at any level (Case 2). If work done at the root is asymptotically more, then our result becomes work done at the root (Case 3). Examples of some standard algorithms whose time complexity can be evaluated using the Master Method Notes: For more details, please refer: Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or if you want to share more information about the topic discussed aboveSolve DSA problems on GfG Practice.In JAVA/C++ Language",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithm-set-5-amortized-analysis-introduction/?ref=ghm,Introduction to Amortized Analysis,"Amortized Analysis is used for algorithms where an occasional operation is very slow, but most of the other operations are faster. In Amortized Analysis, we analyze a sequence of operations and guarantee a worst-case average time that is lower than the worst-case time of a particularly expensive operation. The example data structures whose operations are analyzed using Amortized Analysis are Hash Tables, Disjoint Sets, and Splay Trees. Let us consider an example of simple hash table insertions. How do we decide on table size? There is a trade-off between space and time, if we make hash-table size big, search time becomes low, but the space required becomes high.  The solution to this trade-off problem is to use Dynamic Table (or Arrays). The idea is to increase the size of the table whenever it becomes full. Following are the steps to follow when the table becomes full. 1) Allocate memory for larger table size, typically twice the old table. 2) Copy the contents of the old table to a new table. 3) Free the old table. If the table has space available, we simply insert a new item in the available space. What is the time complexity of n insertions using the above scheme? If we use simple analysis, the worst-case cost of insertion is O(n). Therefore, the worst-case cost of n inserts is n * O(n) which is O(n2). This analysis gives an upper bound, but not a tight upper bound for n insertions as all insertions don’t take Θ(n) time.  So using Amortized Analysis, we could prove that the Dynamic Table scheme has O(1) insertion time which is a great result used in hashing. Also, the concept of the dynamic table is used in vectors in C++ and ArrayList in Java. Following are a few important notes. 1) Amortized cost of a sequence of operations can be seen as expenses of a salaried person. The average monthly expense of the person is less than or equal to the salary, but the person can spend more money in a particular month by buying a car or something. In other months, he or she saves money for the expensive month. 2) The above Amortized Analysis was done for Dynamic Array example is called Aggregate Method. There are two more powerful ways to do Amortized analysis called Accounting Method and Potential Method. We will be discussing the other two methods in separate posts. 3) The amortized analysis doesn’t involve probability. There is also another different notion of average-case running time where algorithms use randomization to make them faster and the expected running time is faster than the worst-case running time. These algorithms are analyzed using Randomized Analysis. Examples of these algorithms are Randomized Quick Sort, Quick Select and Hashing. We will soon be covering Randomized analysis in a different post. Amortized analysis of insertion in Red-Black Tree Let us discuss the Amortized Analysis of Red-Black Tree operations (Insertion) using the Potential Method. To perform the amortized analysis of the Red-Black Tree Insertion operation, we use the Potential(or Physicist’s) method. For the potential method, we define a potential function that maps a data structure to a non-negative real value. An operation can result in a change of this potential. Let us define the potential function in the following manner: (1)   where n is a node of Red-Black Tree Potential function = ,over all nodes of the red black tree. Further, we define the amortized time of an operation as: Amortized time= c + (h) (h)= (h’) – (h) where h and h’ are the states of the Red-Black Tree before and after the operation respectively c is the actual cost of the operation The change in potential should be positive for low-cost operations and negative for high-cost operations. A new node is inserted on a leaf of a red-black tree. We have the leaves of a red-black tree of any one of the following types:  The insertions and their amortized analysis can be represented as: (1) This insertion is performed by first recoloring the parent and the other sibling(red). Then the grandparent and uncle of that leaf node are considered for further recoloring which leads to the amortized cost to be -1(when the grandparent of the leaf node is red), -2 (when uncle of the leaf is black and the grandparent is black) or +1 (when uncle of the leaf is red and grandparent is black). The insertion can be shown as:  (2)  In this insertion, the node is inserted without any changes as the black depth of the leaves remains the same. This is the case when the leaf may have a black sibling or does not have any sibling (since we consider the color of the color of null node to be black). So, the amortized cost of this insertion is 0. (3)  In this insertion, we cannot recolor the leaf node, its parent, and the sibling such that the black depth stays the same as before. So, we need to perform a Left- Left rotation. After rotation, there are no changes when the grandparent of g(the inserted node) is black. Also, for the case of the Red Grandparent of g(the inserted node), we do not have any changes. So, the insertion is completed with amortized cost= +2. The insertion has been depicted below:  After calculating these particular amortized costs at the leaf site of a red-black tree we can discuss the nature of the total amortized cost of insertion in a red-black tree. Since this may happen that two red nodes may have a parent-child relationship till the root of the red-black tree. So in the extreme(or corner) case, we reduce the number of black nodes with two red children by 1, and we at most increase the number of black nodes with no red children by 1, leaving a net loss of at most 1 to the potential function. Since one unit of potential pays for each operation therefore (h) n where n is the total number of nodes Thus, the total amortized cost of insertion in the Red-Black Tree is O(n). For any doubts regarding insertions in a red-black tree, you may refer to Insertions in Red-Black Tree.  For more details, please refer: Design and Analysis of Algorithms.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or if you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice.In JAVA/C++ Language",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/?ref=ghm,What does ‘Space Complexity’ mean?,"Space Complexity: The term Space Complexity is misused for Auxiliary Space at many places. Following are the correct definitions of Auxiliary Space and Space Complexity. Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. For example, if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then Auxiliary Space would be a better criterion than Space Complexity. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort, and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. The space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though. Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.In recursive calls stack space also counts. Example : However, just because you have n calls total doesn’t mean it takes O(n) space.Look at the below function :Note: It’s necessary to mention that space complexity depends on a variety of things such as the programming language, the compiler, or even the machine running the algorithm.Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice.In JAVA/C++ Language",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pseudo-polynomial-in-algorithms/?ref=ghm,Pseudo-polynomial Algorithms,"What is a pseudo-polynomial algorithm? A pseudo-polynomial algorithm is an algorithm whose worst-case time complexity is polynomial in the numeric value of input (not number of inputs).For example, consider the problem of counting frequencies of all elements in an array of positive numbers. A pseudo-polynomial time solution for this is to first find the maximum value, then iterate from 1 to maximum value and for each value, find its frequency in array. This solution requires time according to maximum value in input array, therefore pseudo-polynomial. On the other hand, an algorithm whose time complexity is polynomial in the number of elements in array (not value) is considered as polynomial time algorithm. Pseudo-polynomial and NP-Completeness Some NP-Complete problems have pseudo-polynomial time solutions. For example, Dynamic Programming Solutions of 0-1 Knapsack, Subset-Sum and Partition problems are Pseudo-Polynomial. NP complete problems that can be solved using a pseudo-polynomial time algorithms are called weakly NP-complete. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-polynomial_time StackOverflow – What is pseudopolynomial time?

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polynomial-time-approximation-scheme/?ref=ghm,Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme,"It is a very well known fact that there is no known polynomial time solution for NP Complete problems and these problems occur a lot in real world (See this, this and this for example). So there must be a way to handle them. We have seen algorithms to these problems which are p approximate (For example 2 approximate for Travelling Salesman). Can we do better?Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) is a type of approximate algorithms that provide user to control over accuracy which is a desirable feature. These algorithms take an additional parameter ε > 0 and provide a solution that is (1 + ε) approximate for minimization and (1 – ε) for maximization. For example consider a minimization problem, if ε is 0.5, then the solution provided by the PTAS algorithm is 1.5 approximate. The running time of PTAS must be polynomial in terms of n, however, it can be exponential in terms of ε.In PTAS algorithms, the exponent of the polynomial can increase dramatically as ε reduces, for example if the runtime is O(n(1/ε)!) which is a problem. There is a stricter scheme, Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS). In FPTAS, algorithm need to polynomial in both the problem size n and 1/ε.Example (0-1 knapsack problem):      We know that 0-1 knapsack is NP Complete. There is a DP based pseudo polynomial solution for this. But if input values are high, then the solution becomes infeasible and there is a need of approximate solution. One approximate solution is to use Greedy Approach (compute value per kg for all items and put the highest value per kg first if it is smaller than W), but Greedy approach is not PTAS, so we don’t have control over accuracy.Below is a FPTAS solution for 0-1 Knapsack problem:Input:W (Capacity of Knapsack)val[0..n-1] (Values of Items)wt[0..n-1] (Weights of Items)The above solution works in polynomial time in terms of both n and ε. The solution provided by this FPTAS is (1 – ε) approximate. The idea is to rounds off some of the least significant digits of values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/ε.Example:How is the solution (1 – ε) * OPT?Here OPT is the optimal value. Let S be the set produced by above FPTAS algorithm and total value of S be val(S). We need to show thatLet O be the set produced by optimal solution (the solution with total value OPT), i.e., val(O) = OPT.After the dynamic programming step, we get a set that is optimal for the scaled instanceand therefore must be at least as good as choosing the set O with the smaller profits.

Whenever we find that current digit cannot lead to a solution, we remove it (backtrack) and try next digit. This is better than naive approach (generating all possible combinations of digits and then trying every combination one by one) as it drops a set of permutations whenever it backtracks.Topics :Introduction:Standard Problems on Backtracking:Some Practice problems on Backtracking:Quick Links :If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using write.geeksforgeeks.org or mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.

These problems are typically exponential in terms of time complexity and may require exploring all possible permutations in worst case. The Branch and Bound Algorithm technique solves these problems relatively quickly.Let us consider the 0/1 Knapsack problem to understand Branch and Bound.There are many algorithms by which the knapsack problem can be solved:Let’s see the Branch and Bound Approach to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem: The Backtracking Solution can be optimized if we know a bound on best possible solution subtree rooted with every node. If the best in subtree is worse than current best, we can simply ignore this node and its subtrees. So we compute bound (best solution) for every node and compare the bound with current best solution before exploring the node.Example bounds used in below diagram are, A down can give $315, B down can $275, C down can $225, D down can $125 and E down can $30.Recomended:If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=ghm,Algorithms,"Learn more about Algorithms in DSA Self Paced CoursePractice Problems on all AlgorithmsRecent articles on AlgorithmsThe word Algorithm means ” A  set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations ” Or ” A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently by recursive operations “. Therefore Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.Algorithms can be simple and complex depending on what you want to achieve.There are several types of algorithms available. Some important algorithms are:1. Brute Force Algorithm: It is the simplest approach for a problem. A brute force algorithm is the first approach that comes to finding when we see a problem.2. Recursive Algorithm: A recursive algorithm is based on recursion. In this case, a problem is broken into several sub-parts and called the same function again and again.3. Backtracking Algorithm: The backtracking algorithm basically builds the solution by searching among all possible solutions. Using this algorithm, we keep on building the solution following criteria. Whenever a solution fails we trace back to the failure point and build on the next solution and continue this process till we find the solution or all possible solutions are looked after.4. Searching Algorithm: Searching algorithms are the ones that are used for searching elements or groups of elements from a particular data structure. They can be of different types based on their approach or the data structure in which the element should be found.5. Sorting Algorithm: Sorting is arranging a group of data in a particular manner according to the requirement. The algorithms which help in performing this function are called sorting algorithms. Generally sorting algorithms are used to sort groups of data in an increasing or decreasing manner.6. Hashing Algorithm: Hashing algorithms work similarly to the searching algorithm. But they contain an index with a key ID. In hashing, a key is assigned to specific data.7. Divide and Conquer Algorithm: This algorithm breaks a problem into sub-problems, solves a single sub-problem and merges the solutions together to get the final solution. It consists of the following three steps:8. Greedy Algorithm: In this type of algorithm the solution is built part by part. The solution of the next part is built based on the immediate benefit of the next part. The one solution giving the most benefit will be chosen as the solution for the next part.9. Dynamic Programming Algorithm: This algorithm uses the concept of using the already found solution to avoid repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem. It divides the problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and solves them.10. Randomized Algorithm: In the randomized algorithm we use a random number so it gives immediate benefit. The random number helps in deciding the expected outcome.Analysis of Algorithms:Searching and Sorting:Greedy Algorithms:Dynamic Programming:Pattern Searching:Backtracking:Divide and Conquer:Geometric Algorithm:Mathematical Algorithms:Bitwise Algorithms:Graph Algorithms:Randomized Algorithms:Branch and Bound:Quizzes:Please see Data Structures and Advanced Data Structures for Graph, Binary Tree, BST and Linked List based algorithms.Get DSA’s most popular course at an affordable price, trusted by over 75,000 students!

Also, major tech companies like Microsoft, Uber, Google, Netflix, and Meta use JavaScript in their projects.JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways: Internal JavaScript: We can add JS code directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the <script> & </script>. The <script> tag can either be placed inside the <head> or the <body> tag according to the requirement.Example: It is the basic example of using JavaScript code inside of HTML code, that script enclosing section can be placed in the body or head of the HTML document.Output: The output will display on console. External JavaScript: We can create the file with a .js extension and paste the JS code inside of it. After creating the file, add this file in <script src=”file_name.js”> tag, and this <sctipt> can import inside <head> or <body> tag of the HTML file.Example: It is the basic example of using JavaScript javascript code which is written in a different file.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tutorials/?ref=ghm,HTML,"HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using the markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.HTML is used to create the structure of web pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web (www). It contains Tags and Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.<DOCTYPE! html> – A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.<html> – This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.<head> – This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.<body> – The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.Example 1: This is the basic example of HTML that display the heading and paragraph content.Output:Example 2: This example describes how to create a simple form using HTML. To create a form, we will use <form> tag and inside form tag, we will use some input fields and label elements to display the form.Output:Online Course | Web Design for Beginners: A beginner-level course for the curious Geek inside you!

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-tutorials/?ref=ghm,CSS,"CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.Basic Format: It is the basic structure of CSS style of an webpage.There are three types of CSS which are given below:Example 1: Let’s see a small example of HTML webpage with CSS styles. Here, we use styles to set the alignment and text color of a webpage.Output:Example 2: In this example, we will see how to apply styles using class and id.Output:Tags for formatting a web page were never intended in HTML. HTML was established to define a web page’s content. The addition of tags like <font> and color attributes to HTML created a big problem for web developers. The creation of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to each page, became a time-consuming and costly procedure. CSS was established to address this issue. CSS eliminated the HTML page’s style formatting.  Examples: Please go through this link to see the wide collection of programming examples.

JavaScript is one such programming language that has more than 1444231 libraries and increasing rapidly. It is preferred over any other programming language by most developers. Also, major tech companies like Microsoft, Uber, Google, Netflix, and Meta use JavaScript in their projects.JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways: Internal JavaScript: We can add JS code directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the <script> & </script>. The <script> tag can either be placed inside the <head> or the <body> tag according to the requirement.Example: It is the basic example of using JavaScript code inside of HTML code, that script enclosing section can be placed in the body or head of the HTML document.Output: The output will display on console. External JavaScript: We can create the file with a .js extension and paste the JS code inside of it. After creating the file, add this file in <script src=”file_name.js”> tag, and this <sctipt> can import inside <head> or <body> tag of the HTML file.Example: It is the basic example of using JavaScript javascript code which is written in a different file. By importing that .js file in the head section.Output: The output will display on console.It is mainly used to develop websites and web-based applications.

The phrases arithmetic and higher arithmetic were used as synonyms for number theory until the early twentieth century, and are now occasionally used to refer to a wider section of number theory.Number System is a method of representing Numbers on the Number Line with the help of a set of Symbols and rules. These symbols range from 0-9 and are termed digits. Number System is used to perform mathematical computations ranging from great scientific calculations to calculations like counting the number of Toys for a Kid or Number chocolates remaining in the box. Number Systems comprise multiple types based on the base value for its digits. Further explanation about numbers and number system is provided below:Arithmetic is the foundation of how arithmetic works and how a person may use numbers to solve problems. It dives into the links between numbers and how they might affect one another when a person is trying to solve an issue. Learning more about arithmetic math, how it differs from other forms of math, the numerous topics a person will study, and how it can be used in the real world may help anybody decide why they want to learn more about it. It can also point them in the right direction if they need more support or want to learn something new. Anyone may extend their math skills to the moon and beyond by gradually studying more arithmetic. Following are the major topics covered in arithmetic along with their corresponding divisions: Root, in mathematics, a solution to an equation, usually expressed as a number or an algebraic formula. There exists a special positive real number x such that xn = a, if a is a positive real number and n is a positive integer. So, n√a or a1/n is the number that represents the (principal) nth root of a. The integer n is referred to as the root’s index. When n = 2 is used, the root is referred to as the square root, and it is written as √a. The cube root of a is 3√a. The special negative nth root of an is called principal if an is negative and n is odd. The principal cube root of –27, for example, is –3. If a whole number (positive integer) has a logical nth root that is, one that can be expressed as a typical fraction, then the root must be an integer. Since 22 is less than 5, 5 has no rational square root. Here is a list of the topics that may help to understand roots more deeply:A number game is any of a variety of puzzles and games that include mathematical concepts. Mathematical games and puzzles range from simple amusements to complex problems, some of which have never been solved. Arithmetic, algebra, number theory, group theory, combinatory (problems of configurations or designs), symbolic logic, can all be included. The origins of number games and mathematical recreations, as well as the values on which they are based, are covered in details, such as explanations of the puzzles, games, and recreations are discussed in the articles below:The discussions of ratio, proportion, and percentages in this free course are all about splitting everything into bits. For example, if there are 200 people in a small village and 50 of them are children, this can be expressed as a percentage: 25% of the village population is children; or as a ratio: one child for every four adults; or as a proportion: the proportion of children in the village population is a fifth. Following is the list of references that may help to understand more about this part of arithmetic:The term “exponents” refers to the repeated multiplication of the same element. The exponent, in this case, 3, represents the number of times the value is compounded. For instance, the shorthand for multiplying three copies of the number 2 is shown on the right-hand side of the equals sign as 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. The base is the thing that is being multiplied, which in this case is 5. Let’s learn more about the exponents in further articles as given below:",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/algebra/?ref=ghm,Algebra,"Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with number theory, geometry, and analysis. It is one of the oldest branches in the history of mathematics. Algebra is defined as the analysis of mathematical symbols and laws, as well as the manipulation of these mathematical symbols, according to some definitions. Algebra covers a wide range of topics, from solving basic problems to studying abstractions. Algebra equations are included in several chapters of mathematics that students will study in school. In addition, algebra contains a number of formulas and identities.The definition of algebra is focused on variables, which are undefined values. Equations are a crucial concept in algebra. To execute arithmetic operations, it follows a set of laws. The laws are used to interpret data sets that have two or more variables. It is used to analyze a variety of topics around us. Basic algebra, abstract algebra, linear algebra, advanced algebra, and commutative algebra are some of the sub-branches of algebra are discussed below:Linear algebra is a type of algebra that can be used in both applied and pure mathematics. It is concerned with linear mappings between vector spaces. It also entails the investigation of planes and tracks. It involves the investigation of linear sets of equations with transformation properties. It is concerned with linear equations and their representation in vector spaces and by matrices for linear functions. The following are some of the most important parts discussed in linear algebra:Polynomials Polynomials are made by variables and coefficients, which are algebraic expressions. Indeterminate is another name for variables. For polynomial expressions, we may perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and positive integer exponents, but not division by variable. Following are the topics that discuss polynomials deeply:Linear Equations Linear equations are first-order equations. In the coordinate system, these equations are defined for lines. A linear equation is an equation for a straight line. The straight-line equation is written as y = mx + b, where m denotes the line’s slope and b denotes the y-intercept. The first-order equations are known as linear equations. In the coordinate system, these equations are defined for lines. Since the highest exponent of variables is 1, linear equations are also known as first-degree equations. Following are the topics that discuss linear equations deeply:Abstract algebra is one of the branches of algebra that finds truths about algebraic structures regardless of the existence of certain operations. In certain instances, these operations have special properties. As a result, we can draw certain conclusions about the implications of those properties. As a result, abstract algebra is a subset of mathematics. Groups, sets, modules, rings, lattices, vector spaces, and other algebraic structures are studied in abstract algebra. Following are the list of the articles that discuss the same:Set TheorySet theory is a branch of mathematical logic that investigates sets, which are arrays of objects informally. While any object can be gathered into a group, set theory as a branch of mathematics is mostly concerned with those that are important to all mathematics. Sets are an ordered array of items in mathematics that can be expressed in set-builder or roster form. Sets are usually denoted by curly braces;{} for example, A = {1,2,3,4} is a collection. Let’s learn more about the sets in the following articles:VectorsOne of the most important aspects of algebra is vector algebra. It is a course that focuses on the algebra of vector quantities. There are two kinds of measurable quantities: scalars and vectors, as we all know. The magnitude of a scalar quantity is the only thing that matters, while the magnitude and direction of a vector quantity are also essential. A vector is a two-dimensional object of both magnitude and direction. It is normally represented by an arrow with a length (→) that indicates the magnitude and direction. A vector is a two-dimensional object of both magnitude and direction. It is normally represented by an arrow with a length that indicates the magnitude and direction. The arrowhead on the vector arrow has an arrowhead, and the tail on the other end is the tail. It is denoted by the letter V. The vector’s magnitude is denoted by the letter |V|. Let’s discuss more the vector and its algebra in the following articles:There are advanced styles of algebra taught in schools such as abstract algebra, linear algebra, and standard algebra, in addition to basic algebra. This involves learning how to use a matrix to solve a large number of linear equations at the same time. The analysis of objects contained in equations, moving beyond numbers to the more abstract of classes of numbers, is known as abstract algebra. Let’s discuss more of it in the following topics:Relations and FunctionsThe most significant subjects in mathematics are “Relations and Functions.” Relations and functions are two distinct terms that have different mathematical interpretations. One might be puzzled by the differences between them. Before we go even further, let’s look at a clear example of the differences between the two. An ordered pair is represented as (INPUT, OUTPUT): The relation shows the relationship between INPUT and OUTPUT. Whereas, a function is a relation that derives one OUTPUT for each given INPUT. Let’s discuss more of the topic in the following articles:Matrices and DeterminantsIn linear algebra, determinants and matrices are used to solve linear equations by applying Cramer’s law to a series of non-homogeneous linear equations. Only square matrices are used to measure determinants. While a matrix’s determinant is empty, it’s known as a singular determinant, and when it’s one, it’s known as unimodular. The determinant of the matrix must be nonsingular, that is, its value must be nonzero, for the set of equations to have a unique solution. Let us look at the definitions of determinants and matrices, as well as the various forms of matrices and their properties, using examples in the following articles:Permutations and CombinationsPermutation and combination are methods for representing a collection of objects by choosing them from a list and dividing them into subsets. It specifies the different methods for organizing a set of data. Permutations are used to choose data or events from a group, while combinations are used to represent the order in which they are represented. Let’s discuss them deeply in the following articles:Mathematical InductionFor each and every natural number n, mathematical induction is a technique for proving a proposition, hypothesis, or formula that is assumed to be valid. The ‘Principle of Mathematical Induction is a generalization of this that we can use to prove any mathematical statement. Therefore, let’s learn more about it in the following articles:",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trigonometry/?ref=ghm,Trigonometry,"Hipparchus, a Greek mathematician, introduced the idea of trigonometry, which is one of the most important branches of mathematics. Trigonometry is basically applicable to the Right-angled triangle. In this article, we’ll look at the relationship between the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. The fundamentals of trigonometry describe six functions: sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec, and cot.Trigonometry uses trigonometric ratios (which is the ratio of two sides of the triangle)to determine the angles and incomplete sides of a triangle. Angles are measured in either radians or degrees. Angles in trigonometry that are widely used are 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 15 °, and 18°.Basic Trigonometry covers, tangent, sine, and cosine these are the names given to the three ratios. It can then be expanded to include other ratios and trigonometry in the Cartesian Plane. These trigonometry studies will cover the following topics: Trigonometry in the Cartesian Plane, Graphs of Trigonometric Functions, and Trigonometric Identities are all topics covered in this course. Following are the articles that cover all the topics the same: Inverse trigonometric functions are essentially the inverse functions of the fundamental trigonometric functions sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant. These functions are also known as arcs functions, anti-trigonometric functions, and cyclometer functions. These trigonometry inverse functions are used to calculate the angle for each of the trigonometry ratios. In physics, mechanics, geometry, and navigation, inverse trigonometry functions are widely used.Trigonometry is used to calculate the height of a structure or a mountain. Using trigonometric functions, the distance of a structure from the perspective and the elevation angle can easily calculate the height of a building. It does not have particular applications in solving functional problems, but it is used in a variety of fields. For example, trigonometry is used in the development of computer music: as you might know, sound moves in the form of waves, and this wave pattern is used in the development of computer music by passing it through a sine or cosine function. Below are a few examples of how trigonometry and its functions can be used:",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statistics/?ref=ghm,Statistics,"Statistics is the study of data collection, analysis, perception, introduction, and organization. It is a method of gathering and summarizing results. This has a wide range of uses, from small to large. Stats are used for any data collection, whether it is the study of the country’s population or its economy.Statistics has a wide range of applications in many disciplines, including economics, psychology, geology, weather forecasts, and so on. The information gathered for research here may be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data can also be divided into two types: discrete and continuous. Continuous data has a spectrum rather than a single value, whereas discrete data has a fixed value.When complete census data cannot be obtained, statisticians gather sample data through the creation of complex experiment designs and survey samples. Statistics, in and of itself, offers tools for prediction and forecasting via statistical models. The scientific discipline of probability theory includes sampling theory. In mathematical statistics, the probability is used to investigate the sampling distributions of sample statistics and, more broadly, the properties of statistical procedures like organizing and grouping data through graphs, pie charts, etc as discussed in the articles below:Any statistical method is accurate whether the structure or population under consideration meets the method’s assumptions. The fundamental distinction between classical probability theory and sampling theory is that probability theory begins with the given parameters of a total population and deduces probabilities that apply to samples. Statistical inference, on the other hand, proceeds in the other way, inferring from samples to the parameters of a greater or entire population. Let’s discuss the statistical methods as:",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/probability-in-maths/?ref=ghm,Probability in Maths,"Probability denotes the possibility of anything happening. It is a mathematical branch that deals with the occurrence of a random event. The value ranges from zero to one. Probability has been introduced in mathematics to estimate the likelihood of events occurring. Probability is described as the degree to which something is expected to occur. This is the fundamental probability principle, which is often found in the probability distribution, in which you can hear about the possible results of a random experiment. To determine the likelihood of a particular occurrence occurring, we must first determine the total number of potential outcomes.Probability is a calculation of how likely an incident is to occur. Many events are impossible to forecast with absolute certainty. Using it, we can only estimate the likelihood of an occurrence occurring, i.e. how probable it is to occur. The probability will vary from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating an unlikely occurrence and 1 indicating a certain event.It is focused on the likelihood of anything occurring. The reasoning behind probability is the foundation of scientific probability. If a coin is flipped, the statistical chance of having a head is 1/2. An event’s statistical chance is the chance that the occurrence will occur. It is determined by dividing the number of desirable outcomes by the total number of outcomes is thus termed as theoretical probability and can be learned in the following articles:It is founded on the results of an experiment. The experimental chance can be determined by dividing the total number of trials by the number of potential outcomes. For example, if a coin is flipped ten times and heads are reported six times, the experimental chance of heads is 6/10, or 3/5. Let’s discuss the experimental probability in the following articles:A collection of laws or axioms that apply to all forms is established in axiomatic probability. Kolmogorov developed these axioms, which are known as Kolmogorov’s three axioms. The axiomatic approach to probability quantifies the likelihood of events occurring or not occurring. This definition is covered in detail in the axiomatic probability articles, which include Kolmogorov’s three laws (axioms) as well as numerous examples. The chance of an event or result happening depending on the existence of a prior event or outcome is known as conditional probability. Following are the articles based on the axiomatic probability:",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/geometry/?ref=ghm,Geometry,"Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the forms, angles, measurements, and proportions of ordinary objects. There are two-dimensional forms and three-dimensional shapes in Euclidean geometry. Flat shapes are two shapes in plane geometry that include triangles, squares, rectangles, and circles. 3D forms such as a square, cuboid, cone, and so on are also known as solids in solid geometry. The fundamental geometry is based on points, lines, and planes, as described in coordinate geometry.The various forms of shapes in geometry help us understand the shapes we see in our daily lives. We can measure the field, circumference, and volume of shapes using geometric principles.Plane geometry is concerned with platforms that can be drawn on paper. Lines, circles, and triangles in two dimensions are examples. Plane geometry is another name for two-dimensional geometry. All two-dimensional figures have only two dimensions: length and width. It does not take into account the depth of the shapes. Plane figures have squares, triangles, rectangles, circles, and so on. Any of the most essential terms in plane geometry are described here in the below articles:Solid geometry is concerned with three-dimensional structures such as cubes, prisms, cylinders, and spheres. It is concerned with the figure’s three dimensions, which are length, width, and height. However, certain solids do not have faces (e.g. sphere). The analysis of three dimensions in Euclidean space is known as solid geometry. The structures of our environment are three-dimensional. Both three-dimensional shapes are created by rotating two-dimensional shapes. Faces, corners, and vertices are essential characteristics of 3D forms.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/calculus/?ref=ghm,Calculus,"Calculus is a subset of mathematics concerned with the study of continuous transition. Calculus is also known as infinitesimal calculus or “infinite calculus.” The analysis of continuous change of functions is known as classical calculus. Derivatives and integrals are the two most important ideas of calculus. The integral is the measure of the region under the curve, while the derivative is the measure of the rate of change of a function. The integral accumulates the discrete values of a function over a number of values, while the derivative describes the function at a given point.Calculus, a branch of mathematics founded by Newton and Leibniz, study the pace of transition. Calculus Math is commonly used in mathematical simulations to find the best solutions. It aids us in understanding the changes between values that are linked by a purpose. Calculus Math is mostly concerned with certain critical topics such as separation, convergence, limits, functions, and so on.Calculus Mathematics is generally divided into two types: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus. Both differential and integral calculus consider the effect of a small shift in the independent variable on the equation as it approaches zero. Both discrete and integral calculus serves as a basis for the higher branch of mathematics known as Analysis.Differential Calculus deals with the issues of determining the rate of change of a parameter with respect to other variables. Derivatives are used to find the maxima and minima values of a function in order to find the best solution. The analysis of the boundary of a quotient leads to differential calculus. It is concerned with variables such as x and y, functions f(x), and the resulting variations in x and y. Differentials are represented by the symbols dy and dx. Differentiation refers to the method of determining derivatives. A function’s derivative is defined by dy/dx or f’ (x). It denotes that the equation is the derivative of y with respect to x. Let us go through some main topics discussed in simple differential calculus in the following articles:The analysis of integrals and their properties is known as integral calculus. It is primarily useful for the following two functions: To compute f from f’ (i.e. from its derivative). If a function f is differentiable in the range under consideration, then f’ is specified in that range. To determine the region under a curve. Differentiation is the inverse of integration. As separation can be defined as the division of a part into several small parts, integration can be defined as the selection of small parts to form a whole. It is commonly used to calculate area. A definite integral has a specified boundary beyond which the equation must be computed. The lower and upper limits of a function’s independent variable are defined, and its integration is represented using definite integrals. An infinite integral lacks a fixed boundary, i.e. there is no upper and lower limit. As a result, the integration value is always followed by a constant value. Following are the articles that discuss the integral calculus deeply:",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/

A linear equation is a simple technique to convey a mathematical proposition. Any variable or symbol can be used to represent unknown values, however, in most cases, a variable ‘x’ is used to represent the unknown number in a linear equation with only one variable. A linear equation can be solved using a variety of basic approaches. To acquire the final value of the unknown quantity, the variables are isolated on one side of the equation and the constants are isolated on the other. An algebraic equation is an equality involving variables. The expression on the left of equality is called LHS (Left Hand Side) and on the right is called RHS (Right Hand Side). Some methods to solve algebraic equations like addition or subtraction and multiplication or division and transposing can be learned in this chapter.
